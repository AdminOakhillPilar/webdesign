    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>Polish Buffalo Roller is an innovative clothing brand that was created in order to give the customer what they were looking for; It is a brand that encompasses all types of style and sizes. That way it makes the customer feel happy with clothes and fashion, without any discrimination.The brand was created on January 24, 1996, by entrepreneurs Anselmo Yanzon and Manuel Forconi. It has no special products, but covers everything. From sports to formal, from slippers to shirts, as well as accessories and perfumes. In 1995 the creators bought the Mauritz Widforss hunting weapons store in Stockholm to dispose of the commercial premises, with the aim of buying and selling clothes. But thanks to the economic crisis of 1994, the project could not be launched until the crisis passed in mid-1995.</p>
