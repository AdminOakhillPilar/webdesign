A#m <br>
Grips on your waist <br>
                    C# <br>
Front way, back way <br>

You know that I don't play <br>
D#m <br>
Streets not safe <br>
                    D#m <br>
But I never run away <br>

Even when I'm away <br>

A#m                         C# <br>
OT, OT, there's never much love when we go OT <br>
      D#m <br>
I pray to make it back in one piece <br>

I pray, I pray <br>



           A#m <br>
That's why I need a one dance <br>
           C# <br>
Got a Hennessy in my hand <br>
         D#m <br>
One more time 'fore I go <br>
              D#m <br>
Higher powers taking a hold on me <br>
