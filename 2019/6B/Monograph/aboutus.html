<h1> Who are we?</h1>
<h2>We are last year students from Oakhill school Pilar, Buenos Aires Argentina. And the last semester we wrote Monographs, inspired on the book The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald. All of this, include different topics such as, love, marriage, social relationships, girl power, etc. and what we did was analyze all of this during the roaring twenties under thye light of this awesome book Fitzgerald wrote.
<br>
<br>
 <br>  With the help of Giorgina Fassano Aurio, literature teacher and specialist on English acadremic language, we made different papers, all of them written with different arguments and points of view. We also supported some of our arguments with two philosophical texts; La Confusion del Yo by Giussani and Emma Palesse's article about Baumann's liquid modernity deconstruction. Both of them, helped us to understand the text and to create and write stronger arguments about society and their objectives on the Roaring Twenties.
<br>
<br>
  <br>  Now, we keep on working with Giorgina on literary work, but analyzing a hole other theme with a different perspective, which is gonna be shared later by us on this page, so keep an eye here or you're gonna miss it!
